# PA6-Prediction-for-Costa-Rican-Households-Poverty-Level

For this project, the dataset of Inter-American Development Bank  is used which consists of socio-economic conditions of Costa Rican Households such as education background, family details, home, electricity details, etc. from Kaggle. By analyzing socio-economic conditions of householdâ€™s characteristics, government can identify which households have the highest need for social welfare assistance. By accurately predicting the household poverty level we can help other countries beyond Costa Rica for assessing the social need. The data set used contains 143 variables like home rent, house conditions, education details, household information, etc. and it contains 9557 rows of data. We need to predict the poverty level (Target variable) of household-based information. The target variable is an ordinal variable indicating groups of income level i.e. 
1= extreme poverty 
2= moderate poverty 
3= vulnerable households 
4= non-vulnerable households. 

For this project, we have used statistical analysis tool R for analysis and visualizing insights.
